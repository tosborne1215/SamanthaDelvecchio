	 <h5><p><br>Welcome to my portfolio home page.</br><br> My career as an e-Learning Designer helped me learn and grow not only as an instructional designer, but as a person. I was recognized by my Director as an exemplary team member for showing initiative in taking on more challenges and mentoring other team members on Instructional Systems Design (ISD) principles.</br><br> This website allows you to get to know me and my instructional design skills better. Here you will find more about me, my resume and a sample of my instructional design work. If you have questions or comments you would like to provide, please click the Contact Me link.</br></p></h5>

	<h1>About</h1>
	<h5><p><br>Hello! My name is Samantha Del Vecchio and I currently live in Spokane Washington. Most of my life was spent in the Midwest, but was lucky enough to visit Germany for 2 years in the early 1990’s. </br><br>My technical skills are self-taught; including my skill to build my own PC’s, repairing computers for friends and family, editing images, and creating e-learning. </br><br>I’m highly skilled and experienced in e-Learning Instructional Design with over 10 years of computer-based training development utilizing the ADDIE model, with a focus of developing and designing e-learning for Software and Web Development employees. </br><br>I’m Technologically-savvy and proficient in multiple training development applications and learning management systems (LMS) to include; Microsoft Office suite, Captivate (all versions), Camtasia, SnagIt, CrazyTalk, Dreamweaver, PeopleSoft, SAP SuccessFactors LMS, Oracle Cloud LMS, Atlassian software development tools, Adobe Connect, and Cisco WebEx. </br><br>Throughout my career, I have mentored many team members on how to create e-learning in Captivate, to industry standards for developing e-learning content. I also created the PowerPoint and Captivate templates for the Global Learning & Development team to be used in all training development. </br><br>In 2015 it was determined our employees had a need for some basic programming courses. In response to the need, in a month I gained a basic knowledge of PHP, HTML, Voice XML, and a proprietary language created by my employer, to me assist in the development of the courses. </br><br>In 2016 I gained the approval of the President of my Business Unit, the Vice President of my department and my Director to be converted into a remote employee. </br><br>In 2018 I worked as a core member of our new Learning Management System (LMS) implementation team. Beyond my duties as a core member, I was responsible for republishing over 400 content items into SCORM 2004 and uploading the content and building the courses in the new system. I worked closely with the LMS contractor to find a solution to how we could control access to specific courses and train the other core members on the solution. I also created a demo video to assist other members of the Learning & Development team on how to publish their own courses in Captivate and Camtasia to limit rework.</br></p></h5>
